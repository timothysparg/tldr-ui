To write a blog you must first build a blog? +
Apparently in my mind this is true, so here we are. 

*_tl;dr_*:  _putting disparate technologies together always takes longer than expected_


== Tools 
- Vs Code
- Docker
- Hugo
- asciidoctor
- github 
- netlify


Whilst VS Code and Docker aren't strictly necesary, I've been itching to use the https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers[Container Development] feauture of VS Code. +
You're going to need to install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack[Remote Development extension pack] for this.


== Create a repo
do your thing. 

==  Add a Dockerfile
    
This is pretty standard sauce; using https://github.com/klakegg/docker-hugo[klakegg/docker-hugo] as the base, because the Hugo package provided using `apt-get` is several versions behind which caused issues with the themes. +
Also I was too lazy to build it from source.

[source,docker]
----
FROM klakegg/hugo:0.74.3-ext-ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    ruby-full \
    silversearcher-ag \
    vim \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN gem install asciidoctor:2.0.1 \
    asciidoctor-diagram:1.5.18 \  
    rouge:3.6.0 
 # <1>

COPY ./asciidoctor /usr/local/sbin

RUN chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/asciidoctor
----
<1> `asciidoctor-diagram` not used just yet.

== Do some unsafe stuff with asciidoctor

Hugo calls asciidoctor with the https://asciidoctor.org/man/asciidoctor/#security-settings[`--safe` parameter] which seems reasonable. 
The unreasonable part is that you can't disable it or you pass custom parameters to it.

https://blog.anoff.io/2019-02-17-hugo-render-asciidoc/[Kudos here] for the original idea, I just tweaked it slightly. +
If you place the `asciidoctor` script in `/usr/local/sbin/` it will be evaluated before the original binary located at `/usr/local/bin`, allowing us to intercept the call and do with it as we wish.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/258514
for arg do
  shift
  [ "$arg" = "--safe" ] && continue
  set -- "$@" "$arg"
done

 /usr/local/bin/asciidoctor "$@"
----
WARNING: After I changed the context of the hugo site to not be in a sub-folder, then this wasn't necessary, but it might still come in useful when I want to use diagrams. 

== Add https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_devcontainerjson-reference[.devcontainer.json]

This tells VS Code how to instantiate your container, this file only has the `dockerFile` portion, but if you want to push using your ssh keys, you might want the additional ssh related snippets. +

[source,json]
----
//See https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/devcontainer.json for format details.
{
	"dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
	"extensions": [],
	"runArgs": [ 
		"-v", "${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.ssh:/root/.ssh-localhost:ro", // <1>
		"--name", "hugo_dev" // <2>

	],
	"postCreateCommand": "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cp -r ~/.ssh-localhost/* ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*" // <3>
}
----
<1> mount the ssh keys in a temporary location
<2> name the container so that we get a consistent container name
<3> now that the container is running, move the keys into a better location

Because I'm lazy I added the `--name` argument so that I can always access the container with the same command `docker exec -it hugo_dev  bash -c 'cd /workspaces/blog ; exec "${SHELL:-sh}"'`


== Maybe we should create this blog and set a theme

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it hugo_dev  bash -c 'cd /workspaces/tldr ; exec "${SHELL:-sh}"'
hugo new site tldr
mv tldr/* . <1>
rm tldr
git submodule add https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder.git themes/hugo-coder  
----
<1> we don't need the sub folder - we aren't doing multiple sites

It's also necessary to update the `theme` value to `hugo-coder`, as mentioned on the https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/[hugo-coder homepage]

=== Let's go rouge 

Hugo doesn't seem to support asciidoctor very well; Code highlighting and admonitions need to be https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-blog-with-hugo-and-asciidoctor/[manually added as well].

=== Hello netlify

Finally, lets make these ramblings more accessible. + 
I found the following readings useful in getting this blog hosted.

* https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/
* https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-settings/
* https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#deploy-contexts
* https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/
* https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/
* https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow
* https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/

My final `netlify.toml` looks as follows
[source,toml]
----
[build]
  command = "hugo --gc --minify"
  publish = "public"
  [build.environment]
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.147.9"

[context.production]
  command = "hugo --gc --minify"
  [context.production.environment]
    HUGO_ENV = "production"
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.147.9"

[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "hugo --gc --minify --buildDrafts --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"
  [context.deploy-preview.environment]
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.147.9"
----

Also worth noting that I had to include a `Gemfile` 
[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'asciidoctor'
gem 'rouge'
