*_tl;dr_*: _Some text just doesn't belong in a repository_

Here's a pithy bash one-liner to remove it:

[source,bash]
----
git filter-repo --replace-text=<(echo "P@ssw0rd==><Sigh stop committing you password>")
----

Or if you're one of those flounders that use https://fishshell.com/[fish]:

[source,bash]
----
git filter-repo --replace-text=(echo "P@ssw0rd==><Sigh stop committing you password>"|psub)
----


I am one of those flounders and `psub` always catches me out, because I only ever need to use it just when I've forgotten about it.
